Download the fma_small.zip from https://github.com/mdeff/fma. 

Run code in these notebooks:
1. load_fma_dataset: Loads fma_dataset and explores it.
2. Plot_Spectograms: Plots spectograms for the 8 different genres
3. convert_to_npz: Loads the raw audio, converts each file to a spectogram and pickles the results to make it easy for training models.

Build Model:
1. baseline_model_fma: This model uses the metadata in tracks.csv to load MFCC features and builds a SVC classifier.
2. CRNN_model: This notebook uses the compressed spectograms to build a CRNN model in Keras
